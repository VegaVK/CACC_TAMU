1. Test Launch File - done
2. Test ll_controller (adjust velTrackerGains (Ki,Kp,Kv) if req as - well as BrakeDecelGain) - braking is not smooth
3. Test VelTracker - done, takes time to get to steadystate
3. get fixed steering/fixed vel maps for steering model - done
4. test acc_controller (adjust Kp,Kv gains and BrakeDecelGain) XXX - DELPHI MSGS ISSUE!!!!


## Observations:
Doesnt come to complete stop near zero (maybe need Sliding mode?)
